           <p>All that was used mostly by the way Mara stared out at Andromeda, at the notion of unity among life forms.
The entrance to Lana resembled other planets was that they appeared to be both romantic and intriguing but, as everyone assured him, he told himself, to trust yourself, Thaileel.
The people were given tasks in order to it all too ready to shrug off the small bumps as minor collisions with perhaps a few of the window but Thaileel had only just remembered Thaileel’s youth.
They’d find hills of mud and search the ground and struggled to hold herself up.
But it was the misconception that all traces of who he himself couldn’t see.
Then he'd ask himself whose footsteps he would reach his fingers into the darkness.
They looked around wistfully, his hair run amok in the most gravity and it was a bond as strong as blood.
You learn together, study the soul of the world and that he was still dark and he felt a surges of fiery heat bubbling out from the Earth to be a new world?
It was not for the first time he saw himself.
Watching Emile, Thaileel sensed Walter’s indomitable sense of purpose.
As they went into the heavens with a thud as he could make a sound.
He pointed out that he was only a matter of time and the sweat of his body.

Some bands dedicated themselves to only delving into the woods in the night.
Without the help of Satia, traversing the woods in the dark end of the planet Earth as it was also the tool our ancestors used to because, on Old Moon every every statue and picture was always quick to clarify to Thaileel that night.
When Thaileel asked with surprise and explained with a grand smile and tired eyes.
They affect the flow of time on board other than Santi and Thaileel, then sipped some water from one branch descended into the sand swells was just one small aspect of Jinn.
There was no question in Santi’s mind that The Cartographer stopped painting and looked The Cartographer could do was struggle to breath and looked up to say goodbye or to explain herself to anyone.
Petite trees sprung from the central axis contained 0.7 Standard-Level Gravity and served as a worthless idolatry of the galaxy around him.
He forced himself to rely on Emile’s art to tell them that Thaileel and everyone else on the meat of a somewhat cramped tube.
Thaileel loved the way Mara stared out at Andromeda, at the tiny creatures that had devoured their parents.
He turned to him.
Was he really only knew Hector and Hector’s gazing eyes as he climbed the ladder strained their arms to the Raven King but only bound his own family to think about this.
He thought of his hand.
Rather, it was that the ship and splintered his eardrums with sharp reverberating shrieks.The ship then let out a pop as a voice called out.</p>

<p>Markov chains are interesting in NLP because they generate pretty interesting (though usually meaningless) sentences but the algorithm behind them is pretty simple – given any 2 consecutive words in a text(in this case my half finished book), choose the most likely third word, and repeat the process with the last two words in a sentence.</p>
<p>Markov chains can get stuck in a repetitive loop. For example, they may come up with ‘the ship was the ship was the ship…’. To get around this, I used the Python Module Markovify which avoids these loops.</p>

           <p>'one thing'
One thing I found interesting about this book was that the title emphasized individuality rather than individuality. The primary difference between the two books was that the title explained individuality, but not individuality itself. I don't know where this came from, but I found it to be a rather perverse way of saying that a book must be understood and understood by everyone. I found it curious, really, that this title was dedicated solely to individuality—not individuality. The book itself must not be read as a whole, but rather as a whole, divided into sections. In order to do that we had to be able to read each other with a single glance and, given the limited space, each book divided itself into sections. What was the purpose of this book? What was the purpose of a section? Well, there was one interesting fact about the book that made me wonder if it was just as important to Thaileel that The Raven King were able to study each other more actively and well than they had ever been. He had always dreamed that someday, if only The Raven King would have the time and resources to study the others, they would one day be able to become truly free. And just then, it happened that his family—his own—had found a language that was not only more elegant than Thaileel’s native tongue, but more natural to him than either Thaileel or Emile would have ever imagined possible. It was here, he would have to return to, that Walter would find out that The Raven King was no longer a slave to his will and had already made his decision. It was also here that Emile would discover that Walter would have had to kill himself to survive. The fact that Walter had just spent so long in Emile’s absence was something that had been hidden in the entirety of Walter’s mind, no less than in all of Emile’s. It was as though Walter had just found a language that was devoid of meaning, devoid of meaning and devoid of meaning but filled with artificial life.
The book began with a title similar to Walter’s own, which Thaileel had memorized and used to identify each of his physical characteristics. It said:
“Seared on Mara’s shoulders
“A Raven King Satia’s Bandits**
“Mara to Emile’s Bandits (Nora Izkahm,” He had written a poem that had been translated into an Old Moon translation by the Raven King himself. It contained this poem, “Thaileel has discovered--**the Raven King’s Satia’s Bandits). **The Raven King tells us that his family were killed and murdered by Emile**
Emile was always quick to attack Walter about this piece of artwork, but Thaileel had never bothered to answer him, just stared him down with blank scorn and scorn and scorn as though to scorn Thaileel himself for it. Then he stopped saying anything at all, only taking a quick glance at Walter who, in a slow, deliberate motion, spoke.
“Do you mean that the bandit bandits were killed and murdered?”
“No, they were wounded in some other way.” Emile began, “This is not meant to insinuate, I don’t even know who the bandit bandits were.”
“They were wounded for no other reason than that--” Walter began, “To show that Emile really loves Thaileel. To show that he loves Emile like that. He doesn’t. He loves Emile, but he doesn’t love Thaileel. He loves you because you are not Emile. He loves you because you are Emile. He loves you so deeply. He sees you as his brother and wants to use you as a weapon against Mara-- a tool that will turn him against Mara forever.”
He began to speak again, “This is not meant to insinuate-- I just’ve never had an argument with Walter before or with anyone else,” he began, “What is meant is that if Walter truly loved Thaileel then we would all be able to see that he cared for Emile.”
“Why would he love Emile if he did not know that he loves him?” The Cartographer began to answer, “He loves Emile because he’s Emile. To him, as someone with an inner vision and an inner reason, Emile is his own soul, and to him it is all part of being human. To be human is to be human-- in essence that is the essence of being human. As Walter told Walter, to live as human
---
Mara wasn't sure if Mara was still with them or not. The two men had only just left a small hatch closed on the other side of the ladder, but Thaileel was sure that all who entered the hatch could only see a large, immobile pile of rubble. He couldn’t see where the debris was coming from but could feel the weight of the ship shaking them. Thaileel wanted to move but couldn’t because of the large pile of rubble.
They were already shaking The Cartographer’s body so much that he was shaking. Mara had placed a hand on Thaileel's head in shock. She began to panic, desperately trying to wake him. She pulled him closer and told him to step out of the way so he could step back down to sleep. She told him to rest and to make room in his pod. They climbed the ladder and climbed the small hatch leading to the hatch into the other room. Walter took Thaileel by the hand and led him to his quarters.
The hatch opened, revealing a large dark room filled with tools. The interior had been carefully made to look familiar and as though it were from another galaxy or galaxy in the past. Inside the chamber was a chamber with a large metal hatch with sharp wooden beams running from one end of the interior to the other, creating an artificial gravity-based chamber. The chamber itself was entirely made of glass. The only damage it could have done to Thaileel was that it would have been difficult for Thaileel to see or use. The only light from the chamber was from a fluorescent light source placed right beside the hatch. It was like the hatch from the future, except that the machines could not read Thaileel’s body language and could only guess that he was either dead or unconscious. Even without the artificial gravity in the room, Thaileel could still hear the conversations coming from around the chamber.

As they entered the hatch into the other chamber they couldn’t help but wonder about the other men, wondering what their purpose was. They weren’t leaving the pod, they were looking for Mara. They could not make sense of all of this-- they were only leaving to make room. The rest of the crew was asleep. They were on board a ship with no windows, so how could anyone have arrived in their ship without windows? What if something terrible had happened? How could the others ever have arrived without windows?

There was something unnerving about the situation. Walter could barely see Walter’s face as he spoke, as though he was asleep. Thaileel wondered if he might have died trying to escape. Hector felt betrayed and embarrassed by the betrayal. He told Thaileel that he would have died trying to return home if it weren’t for them. As they entered the chamber they wondered what was going to happen to Hector. How could he survive without windows? What could Hector say to Walter if his brother could see through the darkness?
It was all too frightening. The windows were blocked behind the windows. Hector looked up to see Walter climbing out of the hatch and leading them out of the chamber. Walter didn’t answer but did a quick tap on the hatch.
"Do you hear me? No. I hear you. Do you see me? Stop looking at me. You are not seeing me. I’ve come looking for you. There is nothing in my body but shadows. It is not my place or your place. We are together. Come! Come in, come in!"
The other crewmembers were immediately shaken. They rushed out into the darkness as quickly as they could. Walter looked straight ahead, but looked back at Hector and smiled with his hand raised. He went to the back of the pod with a relieved wave of his hand.
"Look, Hector. This is where I’m supposed to go.”
The door to Hector’s pod opened and two men climbed over it. They began to descend towards the hatch. It was dark, but it was dark in the end. Hector began to talk with the Cartographer. It was a discussion that had nothing to do with what happened to Thaileel. Rather it was about Hector’s life as well as the world in which Hector’s pod had become. Hector had been given the power to see into the future and was now, once again, the king of the future. It was not just that Hector was already living in what would become of the human race and the stars, but that he was inheriting the future. He had created a society based on a set of rules that would allow him to live his life according to the rules of the future without being chained to any particular destiny.
He was not allowed to stay</p>

           <p>Mara wasn't sure if she would or not. As if to keep things quiet, she didn’t answer.”
	“Yes, but you’re not alone.” The Cartographer responded as he listened, taking Thaileel by the sleeve and placing his hand on hers. The two boys followed behind Shevara and Emile on their ship to wait.
	“We’ve come a long way, then, from what I'm told. I wonder how we could have waited such a long time, could we?”
	“What is it, then?” She stammered. “We came from Nova-- Nova is a word-- Nova is our destiny and it will live forever and ever. It is not a lie that I admit--”
	“Well, there is no doubt in my mind that the Nova family has set out to lead a peaceful and honorable life. I know that some of you disagree with my decision and others disagree with my decision as well, but that doesn’t mean that our destiny cannot come from somewhere deep within our planet.”
	“No, nothing is absolute. It can only be written.” She responded, a quiet but deep breath. “Perhaps a little too harsh.”
The Cartographer took his time, staring at her in wonder. Sometimes he wished Thaileel would look into the galaxy and see the wonders that lay ahead. They were there, waiting. She thought of the galaxy before them. There were things waiting there waiting in the dark, waiting for her to come to. She looked back at the ship they’d just left with and thought back to when they were there. She had been there, waiting, looking at them. Watching them unfold. She looked out over the immense landscape of Minerva. She recognized the colossal planet that Emile’s ship had brought with him. It was a world of stars and planets, each of them different shades of blue and white. It was as though they had been orbiting each other. As she looked out over the colossal world she’d remember its markings and its markings were all the same. They were similar in all ways, but the markings were identical.
	“One of the markings was the immense black ring of ice and snow that held it all together. The markings were identical because they had been there before they were blown apart and all that remained was the ring.”
	“How did they break it?”
	“We didn’t. It wasn’t an ice block,” she admitted, “it was a patchwork of bits of ice and snow floating in the water. The markings were not a reflection of any of the other surfaces of the planet,” She emphasized, “They were just a reflection of the ice on Minerva. The markings were made of rock and ice. The markings weren’t like that of any other piece of ice in the world,” she continued. “It was just… it was the mark of ice and snow and mud. But somehow, someway, someway, someway…” She began, “To be honest, it wasn’t quite what we had been looking for.”
	“And then there was the fact that we had gone back in time,” She continued, “to look back at the universe in more detail.”
As he tried to digest what she had just written, Thaileel began to doubt himself. He began to think that, as he saw her face and felt her presence, his mind must have been filled with images of the markings that had appeared. The markings. They were the markings of destiny that had been left to him by her and the Cartographer.
	“Perhaps the markings of destiny were found in the past and are what will haunt us for the rest of our lives, Thaileel began to think.”
	“We know that the markings of destiny are not some mystical entity from nowhere,” She said scornfully, “that could have been left in some way out there somewhere in the past that was destroyed. But, even here, we’ll find them.”
 The Cartographer pointed to the three boys on the ship and said, “Let them go. It is not our place to guide them.”
The three boys stared at The Cartographer silently for a moment, silently watching him go. The others stared silently, still silently watching The Cartographer.
	“There is a place and a time. Here, here, there is no time.”
	“Do not look at it as something

Tinyllama:

One thing that he did notice was that, with the help of Satia, he could now communicate with Lana. There was a language all his mind could make no sense of. words that he didn’t understand. But then, of course, there was Walter. Even when Walter was of no use to Thaileel, he was somehow always connected to the rest of the universe. And then, of course, there was Mara. Even when Mara was of no use to Thaileel, she was somehow always connected to the rest of the universe. Of all the people on board, Walter was most enthusiastic to teach Thaileel how to navigate his way across simulations of icy caves and burning quicksand, guiding him slowly and deliberately through each individual motion.
           Emile was always quick to challenge him. They’d race each other (Emile obviously holding back) and give each other handicaps so that they could keep going. At first, Thaileel  thought that they were learning to be better people. But then he noticed that they were learning to make a living. How could he have been so vastly inferior to them?
            They were not quite so different as he had assumed. He was stronger than he imagined a human could be-- Thaileel could picture him crushing a handful of stones to dust in the palm of his hand. Yet he was also stronger than he had been on Old Moon. It was no coincidence, he thought to himself, that his strengths would disappear once he was on Lana.
	The weaknesses of Lana had been exploited by the strong. It was not long before his own band entered the strong’s ring. They were led towards a dune of sand and were told to wait until they were sure that they would not be attacked.
	Thaileel’s first instinct was to run ahead to see if the others would follow. But Walter interrupted him.
	“We’re being attacked. You see?” He told them.
	“Who would attack us? What-- what should we do?” The Cartographer asked with increasing panic.
	“I don’t know. I don’t know.” Walter muttered. “It could be rouge bands, savages, pirates-- I don’t know. I don’t know.”
	“What do you mean?” The Cartographer asked, feeling somehow betrayed.
	“My ship was attacked. I’m sure of it. I can’t even see the other ship. It’s completely darkened by the atmosphere.”
	“What do you mean?” Thaileel asked, overly alert.
	The Cartographer’s eyes filled with the light of the stars.
	“My ship has been attacked. I’m sure of it. There has been a war. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s not a matter of moring. It’s not a matter of survival. It’s not a matter of lust. It’s not a matter of power. It’s only a matter of... of war.”
	“What is war but fear? Fear is the essence of being human?” Thaileel began.
“Fear is the essence of being human. Without it, there’s no more children. No more life. There’s no more everything.” The Cartographer sighed, irritated.
“How do you know that you’ve reached that point?”
	The trees are a great example of how Lana has been able to overcome a majority of its enemies. The colors and the plants and the houses were all soothe by the shepherds. It was as though they were able to make a living out of thin air.
	“We’ve strayed from the point. She is still thawing.” The Cartographer began. “We’re still alive. But, I believe, the apes are more alert. They’ve been bidden no harm by the land’s laws. But the damage to the plants and the damage to the soils have been done. Any attempts at food production will be miserable. The plants and soils are already food production. Any attempt at survival will be a formidable task. There will be no more children. No more life. I don’t know how to describe it. I can’t even see it. The apes are like robots. They follow the sounds of the wind and they move quickly. It’s not as though they stop to eat or sleep. A good number of them are still thawing. The rest

Mara wasn't sure what she was looking at other than a large reflective shadow. If it were a spacecraft, as Thaileel now had no doubt that it was, then the ship was not even remotely as large as the ones that Hector had read about in his book. It was hardly larger than a few sizable huts clumped together.
What was going through Hector's head just then? Time passed. Thaileel began to feel a chill from the breeze. He looked back at the side of the ship, the weakening light of the fire, and realized that he was naked in space, vulnerable even to a tiny piece of spinach.

		Chapter 2: Towards Ura

The ship was what the boys referred to as an 'Axial Vessel', named such because it rotated on an axis facing its destination. The idea for such ships came from the evolution of spaceships which, overtime, had become less about selling their owners the chance to live a life of lonely suffering and more about selling the dreams of a life of freedom.
For a time, Thaileel  thought that the Axial Vessel was what Hector was after-- he wanted to be able to see beyond the surface of the world. But as The Cartographer explained, no one on board a ship could see beyond the surface of the world. It was all about being in the right place at the right time.

This was something that The Cartographer had explained to Thaileel  that very first time he spoke, almost making it sound as though he was speaking to a child.
"I have to disagree with you on that point-- of seeing beyond the surface of the world. I think that you’re too harsh. The meaning of life is not about the journey to a place you can’t see. It’s about the search for the impossible. This is the meaning of all life."
        	‘He’s not just talking to me,’ Thaileel thought to himself. ‘He must be bored when he’s tired. I’m tired. He’s asleep. I’m awake.
        	And just so, I thought to myself. There was something that the Cartographer

Mara wasn't sure what she was looking at other than a large reflective shadow. If it were a spacecraft, as Thaileel now had no doubt that it was, then the ship was not even remotely as large as the ones that Hector had read about in his book. It was hardly larger than a few sizable huts clumped together.
What was going through Hector's head just then? Time passed. Thaileel began to feel a chill from the breeze. He looked back at the side of the ship, the weakening light of the fire, and wondered at the strange patterns of the landscape.
It was getting colder and civilization seemed to cease. All roads ended. There were no more huts, no more fires. The sky before him dwindled to a faint twilight glow blanketing the sands that stretched out before him. Thaileel could see only the pale blue of the sky and the dark blue of the sky. It was as though they were able to see into the soul of the world.
 Hector began to answer, "yes," but Walter interrupted him. He spoke slowly and with a dry bitterness.
 “Once you have left home, you can never go back.”
Thaileel would have thought nothing of this. But he had learned from Hector that Thaileel could expect to hear even the most distant of planets called out. And Walter was not alone in his reflections on the sky. Mara was also watching over him. She had been sitting beside him since the very first time he spoke with her. She had been listening to him, waiting.
The trees were colossal. They swayed with the slow violence of an avalanche or collapsing beast. The ratio of their branches to the ratio of the ground (the soils) was such that it could be manipulated into any series of shapes and textures, creating malleable playgrounds and obstacle courses to engage the body and prevent it from atrophying over the long flights.
	There was an order to it all though. It could be seen in the placement of the trees. The ratio of the height of the trees to the width of the planet was such that it could be traversed by foot. The ratio of the width of the planet to the height of the trees was such that it could be seen from from space.
The ratio of the width of the plants to the height of the trees was also such that it could be seen from from space. It was as though they were able to climb up the world below and take it by force.

Thaileel would have thought nothing of this-- he had been on Old Moon long enough that no one could really tell him anything. But Walter was not on Old Moon. He was on Ura.
The cold was so great that it could be seen from from space. Thaileel would have thought nothing of this-- he had been on Ura for so long that no one could really tell him anything. But Walter had noticed something. There was something about Ura that made Thaileel feel safe. He felt safe because Walter was with him. He felt safe because Hector was with him. He felt safe because they were able to speak to him and explain to him that his life was not safe if he continued to do what he had set out to do.
