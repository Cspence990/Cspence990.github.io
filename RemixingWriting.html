           <p>In this experiment, I wanted to experiment with generative AI that would only use my own creative writing. I didn’t expect any of the writing to be good but I wanted to see:</p>
<p>1. How different algorithms and models handled the task differently</p>
<p>2. How it transformed my writing</p>
<p>3. If it had any interesting ideas</p>
           <p>All of the models below were trained on a partially completed science fiction book I wrote almost 10 years ago.</p>

           <p>Ura was quite different than Thaileel had envisioned. There were no gentle breezes or blue skies-- only a dark, frigid haze. Beneath the haze lay thick pools of black ice, black like soot with frozen mud and rusted sand smeared across the surfaces. There were veins of white ice spread throughout the tundra that bled into the sand like mold festering on the meat of a dead animal. With each step, Thaileel could feel the shiver of the land’s decrepit body. The air was so dry and so bitterly cold that it stung Thaileel’s throat like burning sandpaper.</p>

Without the help of Satia, traversing the woods in the dark end of the planet Earth as it was also the tool our ancestors used to because, on Old Moon every every statue and picture was always quick to clarify to Thaileel that night.

There was no question in Santi’s mind that The Cartographer stopped painting and looked The Cartographer could do was struggle to breath and looked up to say goodbye or to explain herself to anyone.

Thaileel loved the way Mara stared out at Andromeda, at the tiny creatures that had devoured their parents.
He turned to him.

<p>Markov chains are interesting in NLP because they generate pretty interesting (though usually meaningless) sentences but the algorithm behind them is pretty simple – given any 2 consecutive words in a text(in this case my half finished book), choose the most likely third word, and repeat the process with the last two words in a sentence.</p>
<p>Markov chains can get stuck in a repetitive loop. For example, they may come up with ‘the ship was the ship was the ship…’. To get around this, I used the Python Module Markovify which avoids these loops.</p>

<p>This neural network focuses on predicting individual letters instead of words and, one iteration at a time, it creates a story letter by letter. One drawback of this particular neural network is that it can get caught in a repetitive loop like those mentioned above.</p>

Mara wasn't sure if Mara was still with them or not. The two men had only just left a small hatch closed on the other side of the ladder, but Thaileel was sure that all who entered the hatch could only see a large, immobile pile of rubble. He couldn’t see where the debris was coming from but could feel the weight of the ship shaking them. Thaileel wanted to move but couldn’t because of the large pile of rubble.
They were already shaking The Cartographer’s body so much that he was shaking. Mara had placed a hand on Thaileel's head in shock. She began to panic, desperately trying to wake him. She pulled him closer and told him to step out of the way so he could step back down to sleep. She told him to rest and to make room in his pod. They climbed the ladder and climbed the small hatch leading to the hatch into the other room. Walter took Thaileel by the hand and led him to his quarters.
The hatch opened, revealing a large dark room filled with tools. The interior had been carefully made to look familiar and as though it were from another galaxy or galaxy in the past. Inside the chamber was a chamber with a large metal hatch with sharp wooden beams running from one end of the interior to the other, creating an artificial gravity-based chamber. The chamber itself was entirely made of glass. The only damage it could have done to Thaileel was that it would have been difficult for Thaileel to see or use. The only light from the chamber was from a fluorescent light source placed right beside the hatch. It was like the hatch from the future, except that the machines could not read Thaileel’s body language and could only guess that he was either dead or unconscious. Even without the artificial gravity in the room, Thaileel could still hear the conversations coming from around the chamber.

As they entered the hatch into the other chamber they couldn’t help but wonder about the other men, wondering what their purpose was. They weren’t leaving the pod, they were looking for Mara. They could not make sense of all of this-- they were only leaving to make room. The rest of the crew was asleep. They were on board a ship with no windows, so how could anyone have arrived in their ship without windows? What if something terrible had happened? How could the others ever have arrived without windows?

There was something unnerving about the situation. Walter could barely see Walter’s face as he spoke, as though he was asleep. Thaileel wondered if he might have died trying to escape. Hector felt betrayed and embarrassed by the betrayal. He told Thaileel that he would have died trying to return home if it weren’t for them. As they entered the chamber they wondered what was going to happen to Hector. How could he survive without windows? What could Hector say to Walter if his brother could see through the darkness?
It was all too frightening. The windows were blocked behind the windows. Hector looked up to see Walter climbing out of the hatch and leading them out of the chamber. Walter didn’t answer but did a quick tap on the hatch.
"Do you hear me? No. I hear you. Do you see me? Stop looking at me. You are not seeing me. I’ve come looking for you. There is nothing in my body but shadows. It is not my place or your place. We are together. Come! Come in, come in!"
The other crewmembers were immediately shaken. They rushed out into the darkness as quickly as they could. Walter looked straight ahead, but looked back at Hector and smiled with his hand raised. He went to the back of the pod with a relieved wave of his hand.
"Look, Hector. This is where I’m supposed to go.”
The door to Hector’s pod opened and two men climbed over it. They began to descend towards the hatch. It was dark, but it was dark in the end. Hector began to talk with the Cartographer. It was a discussion that had nothing to do with what happened to Thaileel. Rather it was about Hector’s life as well as the world in which Hector’s pod had become. Hector had been given the power to see into the future and was now, once again, the king of the future. It was not just that Hector was already living in what would become of the human race and the stars, but that he was inheriting the future. He had created a society based on a set of rules that would allow him to live his life according to the rules of the future without being chained to any particular destiny.
He was not allowed to stay</p>

<p>Going beyond an RNN with my text alone seemed like a futile attempt (I think I’d need a much more expensive computer!) so I decided to fine-tune a few models. GPT-2 was my first exposure to AI generated text and the first large language model that I ever fine-tuned.</p>

           <p>Mara wasn't sure if she would or not. As if to keep things quiet, she didn’t answer.”
	“Yes, but you’re not alone.” The Cartographer responded as he listened, taking Thaileel by the sleeve and placing his hand on hers. The two boys followed behind Shevara and Emile on their ship to wait.
	“We’ve come a long way, then, from what I'm told. I wonder how we could have waited such a long time, could we?”
	“What is it, then?” She stammered. “We came from Nova-- Nova is a word-- Nova is our destiny and it will live forever and ever. It is not a lie that I admit--”
	“Well, there is no doubt in my mind that the Nova family has set out to lead a peaceful and honorable life. I know that some of you disagree with my decision and others disagree with my decision as well, but that doesn’t mean that our destiny cannot come from somewhere deep within our planet.”
	“No, nothing is absolute. It can only be written.” She responded, a quiet but deep breath. “Perhaps a little too harsh.”
The Cartographer took his time, staring at her in wonder. Sometimes he wished Thaileel would look into the galaxy and see the wonders that lay ahead. They were there, waiting. She thought of the galaxy before them. There were things waiting there waiting in the dark, waiting for her to come to. She looked back at the ship they’d just left with and thought back to when they were there. She had been there, waiting, looking at them. Watching them unfold. She looked out over the immense landscape of Minerva. She recognized the colossal planet that Emile’s ship had brought with him. It was a world of stars and planets, each of them different shades of blue and white. It was as though they had been orbiting each other. As she looked out over the colossal world she’d remember its markings and its markings were all the same. They were similar in all ways, but the markings were identical.
	“One of the markings was the immense black ring of ice and snow that held it all together. The markings were identical because they had been there before they were blown apart and all that remained was the ring.”
	“How did they break it?”
	“We didn’t. It wasn’t an ice block,” she admitted, “it was a patchwork of bits of ice and snow floating in the water. The markings were not a reflection of any of the other surfaces of the planet,” She emphasized, “They were just a reflection of the ice on Minerva. The markings were made of rock and ice. The markings weren’t like that of any other piece of ice in the world,” she continued. “It was just… it was the mark of ice and snow and mud. But somehow, someway, someway, someway…” She began, “To be honest, it wasn’t quite what we had been looking for.”
	“And then there was the fact that we had gone back in time,” She continued, “to look back at the universe in more detail.”
As he tried to digest what she had just written, Thaileel began to doubt himself. He began to think that, as he saw her face and felt her presence, his mind must have been filled with images of the markings that had appeared. The markings. They were the markings of destiny that had been left to him by her and the Cartographer.
	“Perhaps the markings of destiny were found in the past and are what will haunt us for the rest of our lives, Thaileel began to think.”
	“We know that the markings of destiny are not some mystical entity from nowhere,” She said scornfully, “that could have been left in some way out there somewhere in the past that was destroyed. But, even here, we’ll find them.”
 The Cartographer pointed to the three boys on the ship and said, “Let them go. It is not our place to guide them.”
The three boys stared at The Cartographer silently for a moment, silently watching him go. The others stared silently, still silently watching The Cartographer.
	“There is a place and a time. Here, here, there is no time.”
	“Do not look at it as something</p>
