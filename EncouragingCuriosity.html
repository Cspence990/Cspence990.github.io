<p>Cognitive Strategies as Means of Encouraging Curiosity in Students
by Clayton Spencer</p>

<p>Abstract
This paper focuses on ways in which teachers can encourage students’ curiosity in the classroom.
First, literature on how teachers can encourage curiosity is reviewed. Then, obstacles to
curiosity, such as cognitive overload, are considered. Finally, the use of cognitive strategies as a
means of overcoming these obstacles to curiosity is proposed.
Keywords: Curiosity, Cognitive Strategies</p>

<p>Cognitive Strategies as Means of Encouraging Curiosity in Students</p>

<p>Teachers have the ability to create environments that encourage curiosity. However, even
in environments that encourage curiosity, some students may struggle to interact with stimuli that
evokes curiosity. This issue may not be due to a lack of curiosity on the part of the student, but a
lack of skills that prevent students from noticing interesting phenomena. The use of cognitive
strategies, such as utilizing prior knowledge to comprehend complex texts, may result in students
engaging in more exploratory and inquisitive behaviors.</p>

<p>What is Curiosity and Why Is It Important?</p>

<p>Curiosity may generally be described as “the desire for new knowledge, information,
experiences, or stimulation to resolve gaps or experience the unknown” (Grossnickle, 2016). In
quantitative studies, it has been measured by observing how frequently students demonstrate a
desire to know about something in their learning environment.</p>

<p>Curiosity is theorized as being a cause of intrinsic motivation (Reeve, 1989) and
Goodwin (2014) found that “studies have linked curiosity to better job performance (Reio &amp;
Wiswell, 2000); greater life satisfaction and meaning (Kashdan &amp; Steger, 2007); and even longer
lives (Swan &amp; Carmelli, 1996).”</p>

<p>The Role of Teachers in Creating Conditions That Encourage Student Curiosity</p>

<p>Curiosity is used by instructors to engage students in instructional activities. Keller
(2000) writes that,
First, a lesson must gain the learner's attention. Tactics for this can range from simple
unexpected events (e.g. a loud whistle, an upside-down word in a visual) to mentally
stimulating problems that engage a deeper level of curiosity, especially when presented at
the beginning of a lesson.
Engel (2011) argues that teachers can create conditions for student curiosity by being
encouraging. Her 2011 article provides summaries of experiments that found that students were
more likely to explore unfamiliar phenomena when teachers smiled, encouraged exploration, and
were willing to stray from a scripted lesson. Although the studies cited by Engel are unpublished
(and therefore their methodology may not be scrutinized), other studies support the conclusion
that children are more likely to explore their surrounding environment when in the presence of
adults who are either familiar or encourage exploration (Salter Ainsworth &amp; Bell, 1970;
Henderson &amp; Moore, 1980).
Pedagogical techniques may also result in an increase of student behavior that is
indicative of curiosity. Lowry and Johnson (1981) demonstrated that the use of controversy can
result in heightened curiosity in students. In their study, they found that students who learned
using texts with conflicting positions (whether economic interests were superior to
environmental interests) were more likely to be observed engaging in information seeking
behaviors than students who used texts that did not have conflicting positions. This study
supports the claim that teachers are able to successfully encourage curiosity in a classroom
setting.</p>

<p>The Potential Role of Cognitive Strategies in Encouraging Curiosity</p>

<p>Even with conditions that encourage curiosity, students still might face obstacles to
expressing their curiosity. For instance, Keller (2008), raises the issue of cognitive load. Even in
a welcoming environment with stimulating materials that present a gap in knowledge, there may
be too much extraneous load for a student to interact with materials in a meaningful way. This
may prevent students from gaining an awareness of stimuli that they may find to be enticing in
such a way that would otherwise cause curiosity.
The use of cognitive strategies on the part of the student may provide a way around such
obstacles to curiosity. Deimann and Keller (2006) found that the use of implementation
intentions (a volitional strategy) can reduce extraneous load in the working memory. This could
allow for students to engage with curiosity provoking stimuli without feeling cognitive overload.
For example, a student in Lowry and Johnson’s 1981 study on controversy with limited reading
comprehension may not engage in knowledge seeking behavior despite reading texts that
highlight a controversy due to cognitive overload. The student may be so focused on vocabulary,
names, and unfamiliar concepts that they are not able to notice that there is a controversy. The
use of implementation intentions could free up space in their working memory so that they can
comprehend the texts thoroughly enough to appreciate the controversies and possibly feel
stimulated to engage in autonomous knowledge seeking behavior related to the text.
It should be noted that Diemann and Keller’s 2006 article also highlighted issues that
might arise from curiosity -- students may lose sight of their original task due to fits of short
lived curiosity. In such cases, implementation intentions can also help students focus on more
substantial goals without necessarily limiting their curiosity.
Other cognitive strategies may also play a role. For instance, utilizing prior knowledge
may allow for students to not only comprehend a text but also become more curious about the
content of a text. Loewenstein (1994) argued that
The general prediction that curiosity should increase with knowledge has already
received some empirical support. In Berlyne's (1954b) experiment reviewed earlier, for
example, questions about more familiar animals evoked greater curiosity. A similar
finding was obtained by S. Jones (1979), who … [observed] a significant correlation (.51)
between self-evaluated knowledge of a particular item and curiosity about that item. He
concluded that "subjects were more curious toward items about which they already had
some knowledge than toward those about which they had little or no knowledge" (S.
Jones, 1979, p. 640).
Therefore, teaching and encouraging the use of assessing prior knowledge about subjects
within readings may boost curiosity as well as comprehension.
These findings do not necessarily indicate that the use of cognitive strategies will result in
more curiosity on the part of the student. An ability to read, comprehend, and connect with a text
does not necessarily result in a desire to learn more about aspects of the text. However, such
abilities may make it more likely that students will engage in knowledge seeking behavior,
which is indicative of curiosity.</p>

<p>Conclusion and Suggestions for Future Study</p>

<p>Curiosity has numerous benefits to people of all ages (Goodwin, 2014) and empirical
evidence suggests that teachers can have an impact on student curiosity (Hackmann &amp; Engel,
2002; Lowry &amp; Johnson, 1981; Henderson &amp; Moore, 1980; Salter Ainsworth &amp; Bell, 1970).
However, the presence of students and engaging stimuli may not result in curiosity on the part of
the student if students lack the skills necessary to engage with the stimuli. Cognitive strategies
may provide a pathway for these students to exercise their curiosity in productive ways in class
activities.
Current studies provide an indirect link between the use cognitive strategies and
knowledge seeking behavior. Future research may focus on finding a direct link between these
two constructs.</p>
