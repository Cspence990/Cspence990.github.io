           <p>This graph was created using the Python modules Pyvis and Spacy.</p>

            <p>First, I used Spacy to create a list of named entities within the text, like names and locations. Anytime more than one named entity appeared in a paragraph, a relationship was recorded. This data was then used in Pyvis to create this graph.</p>

<p>Obviously, nuance and meaning is lost in this graph. Additionally, other than weeding out entities like ordinal numbers and money, I used default named entity recognition settings in Spacy, which can make mistakes.</p>

<p>Despite these limitations, this graph does give a sense of some of the major topics within the speech.</p>
