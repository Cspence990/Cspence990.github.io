           <p>In this project, I scraped over 3,000 declassified CIA briefings from the 1950s and examined the data using a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.</p>
            <p>I chose this dataset because it seemed perfect for experimenting with NLP -- reading all of these briefs and identifying patterns would be immensley time consuming and it would be easy to miss larger themes. THis is where NLP can be useful.</p>
            <p>First, I used the Python module BeautifulSoup (though in hindsight, I really regret not looking into Scrapy) to scrape the CIA website, which does not prohibit web-scraping.</p>
           <p>Once I had the data, which were scans in PDF format, I transfered it to plaintext and did a bit of pre-processing before exploring it.</p>
            <p>Pre-processing included removing random noise from the original document (smudges from photocopies and stamps showed up as gibberish and random punctuations when transfered to plaintext), removing common words with little meaning (stop words), spellchecking and lemmatizing the rest of the words (putting words in their root form).</p>
            <p>Spellchecking was the most computationally expensive step in this process. Because the documents were photoscans from the 1950s, a lot of words transferred to text incorrectly. For example, the word 'example' may have been coded as '3x ample' or 'exmq1e'.</p>
            <p>To get around this, I created a function that checked the word similarity of every word to known words. If there was a match of over 90%, the correctly spelled word was used. Otherwise, the word was abandoned.</p>

           <p>This graph shows the connections between terms like names, organizations, events, and locations. It was created using the Python modules Pyvis and Spacy.</p>

            <p>First, I used Spacy to create a list of named entities within the text (such as names and locations). Anytime more than one named entity appeared in a paragraph, a relationship was recorded. This data was then used in Pyvis to create this graph.</p>

<p>Obviously, nuance and meaning is lost in this graph. Additionally, other than weeding out entities like ordinal numbers and money, I used default named entity recognition settings in Spacy, which can make mistakes.</p>
<p>If all of the connections were shown, the map would be too tangled. Therefore only the most frequent connections are shown in this graph.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this graph does give a sense of some of the major topics within the speech.</p>

      <p>This map was created using the Python modules Folium and Spacy.</p>

<p>First, I used Spacy to track mentions of geopolitical entities. Then, I used Folium to indicate these locations as well as their frequency on a choropleth map.</p>
          <p>One additional step that I took in generating this map was to match geopolitical entities that weren't modern-day nations with the appropriate label.</p>
          <p>For example, Paris would be marked as France and the USSR would be marked as Russia.</p>

      <p>These visualizations use the LDA algorithm to show some of the major themes in the documents.</p>
          <p>To me, Word Clouds communicated the findings most effectively. However, I also thought pyLDAvis was an interesting visualization of this data worth including as well.</p>
          <p>At first, the Word Clouds were overcrowded with the same words, such as 'intelligence' and 'central'.</p> 
          <p>However, after a bit of cleaning, more specific words began to emerge, which gave more detailed hints about the general contents of the documents.</p>
